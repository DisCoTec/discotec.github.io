# FORTE 2019 - 39th International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems

## Scope
FORTE 2018 is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models, tools, and applications for distributed systems. The conference solicits original contributions that advance the science and technologies for distributed systems, with special interest in the areas of:

* Component- and model-based design
* Object technology, modularity, software adaptation
* Service-oriented, ubiquitous, pervasive, grid, cloud, and mobile computing systems
* Software quality, reliability, availability, and safety;
* Security, privacy, and trust in distributed systems;
* Adaptive distributed systems, self-stabilization;
* Self-healing/organizing;
* Verification, validation, formal analysis, and testing of the above.

Contributions that combine theory and practice and that exploit formal methods and theoretical foundations to present novel solutions to problems arising from the development of distributed systems are encouraged. FORTE covers distributed computing models and formal specification, testing and verification methods. The application domains include all kinds of application-level distributed systems, telecommunication services, Internet, embedded and real-time systems, as well as networking and communication security and reliability.
