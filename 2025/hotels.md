# Hotels in Lille


DisCoTec 2025 will take place in Lille, France (see information about the venue [here](venue)).
We strongly recommend booking a room **as soon as possible**: mid June is a busy period in the Lille area. 

The DisCoTec events will take place on Campus Scientifique, which is located south-east of Lille in Villeneuve d'Ascq. The campus is about 7 km from the city center, where most hotels are located. Still, we recommend staying in the center, as there is a good metro connection with the campus. 
For transport information, we recommend to use [Ilévia](https://www.ilevia.fr/) or Google Maps.  

You can book accommodation using well-known platforms such as [booking.com](https://www.booking.com) and [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com).
 
Alternatively, we will arrange some limited block reservations and special deals at selected hotels for DisCoTec participants. These rooms will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. For details about room types etc. please see the hotel websites, or contact the hotel directly. To secure your booking, please follow the instructions below.
