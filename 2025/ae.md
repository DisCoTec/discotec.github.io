# Artefact Evaluation

Following [ACM's definition](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current), an artefact is "a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results".

To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in the DisCoTec community, authors of submitted papers are invited to submit publicly available artefacts (using permanent repositories such as [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/howto-archive-and-reference-your-code/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), etc.), which will be associated with their paper for evaluation. Based on the result of the artefact evaluation, one or more **badges** may be applied to a paper. Specifically, DisCoTec uses the [EAPLS badging scheme)](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges), which in its own turn is based on and consistent with the ACM initiative.

Artefact submission is 

- **mandatory for tool papers**: the result of the artefact evaluation will be *considered in the tool paper’s acceptance decision*
- **optional for all the other paper categories**: the result of the artefact evaluation *will not affect the paper’s acceptance decision but may affect the best paper selection*

## Why Submitting an Artifact

In summary:

* it is good scientific practice and a valuable contribution for the community;
* it is mandatory and affect the acceptance decision for tool papers;
* for any paper, badges may be assigned to acknowledge the availability and functionality of provided artefacts;
* authors of artefacts may be given a session at the conference to present their artefacts;
* authors of valuable artefacts may be invited to submit their artefacts to a special issue.

## Artefact Submission Dates

See the [Dates](dates) page.

## Artefact Evaluation

We will be attributing 3 badges, according to [EAPLS guidelines](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/):

1. Artefact **functional**: documented, consistent, complete, exercisable;
2. Artefact **reusable**: exceeding functional, by being carefully documented and well-structured for reuse and repurposing, see below for details;
3. Artefact **available**: available on a publicly accessible archival repository to a permanent repository that provides a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

## Evaluation Criteria

All artefacts are evaluated by the artefact evaluation committee. Each artefact will be reviewed by at least two committee members. Reviewers will read the paper and explore the artefact to evaluate how well the artefact supports the claims and results of the paper.

### Criteria for the "functional" badge
The evaluation and the awarding of the functional badge is based on the following questions:

* Is the artefact **documented**, i.e., at minimum, an inventory of artefacts is included, and sufficient description to enable the artefacts to be exercised is included.
* Is the artefact **consistent**, i.e., relevant to the associated paper, significantly contributing to the generation of its main results?
* Is the artefact **complete**, i.e., and as far as possible, are all components relevant to the associated paper included?
* Is the artefact **runnable**, i.e., can the software/scripts that generates the results in the associated paper be executed successfully, and can included data be accessed and appropriately manipulated?

### Criteria for the "available" badge

To get the **available** badge, please upload your VM to a permanent repository that provides a DOI, such as Zenodo, figshare, or Dryad and use this DOI link in your artefact submission.

### Additional criteria for the "reusable" badge

Artefacts seeking the "reusable" badge need to clear a significantly higher bar than functional artefacts. First, they must be available, i.e., receive an "available" badge. Second, we expect a higher level of quality during the evaluation of the functional level. Third, in addition to the criteria from the functional level, they are evaluated against the following criteria:

* Does the artefact have a licence which allows reuse, repurposing, and which is easy to use?
* Are all dependencies and used libraries well documented and up to date?
* Does the artefact README explain in sufficient detail how the artefact can be used beyond the paper?
* Does the artefact provide documented interfaces for extensions, or is the artefact open source?
* Can the artefact be used in a different environment, e.g., built on another system, used outside of the VM or Docker image, etc.?


## Submission Guidelines

Submission site: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=coordination2024](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=coordination2024). Please select the "Artefact Evaluation COORDINATION 2024” track when making a new submission and use the same title (and pdf of the paper) as for the COORDINATION submission.

A final artefact submission should consist of

* an  **abstract**
   * that summarises the artefact and explains its relation to the paper including
   * a URL from which a **.zip** file containing the artefact can be downloaded – we encourage you to provide a DOI – and
   * the **SHA256** checksum of the .zip file (on submission), and,
   * if applicable, a description of any special requirements beyond a VM or Docker image (e.g., cloud-computing resources, certain hardware, etc.), and,
   * Please indicate for which badges you aim at and how they are supported 
   * if you are aiming for a reusable badge, an explanation why you believe your artefact is reusable
* a **.pdf** file of the submitted paper.

You can upload the **abstract** as a separate pdf (<em> pdf of the paper </em>) or as an appendix to the submitted (COORDINATION) research paper. In the latter case, upload the paper with the appendix  (<em> pdf of the paper </em>).

When uploading your artefact to the URL, please update the **SHA256** checksum of the .zip file in the abstract. You can generate the checksum using the following command-line tools.

* Linux: sha256sum
* Windows: CertUtil -hashfile SHA256
* MacOS: shasum -a 256

## Packaging Guidelines
Your artefact .zip file must contain the following elements.

* The **artefact**, i.e., data, software, libraries, scripts, etc. required to replicate the results of your paper. Where applicable please prepare a Docker Image or a Virtual Machine. You could use VirtualBox to save a VM image as an OVA file.
* A LICENSE file. This does not need to be complicated. Your licence simply needs to allow the artefact evaluation chairs to download and distribute the artefact to the artefact evaluation committee members and the artefact evaluation committee members must be allowed to evaluate the artefact, e.g., use, execute, and modify the artefact for the purpose of artefact evaluation.
* A README text file that introduces the artefact to the user and guides the user through replication of your results. Ideally, it should consist of the following parts:
   * Any additional requirements for running the artefact, such as hardware requirements or additional proprietary software;
   * The expected total runtime to run the experiments;
   * Detailed and specific reproducibility instructions to setup and use the artefact to replicate the results in the paper; including an explanation which claims and results cannot be replicated and why.
     
If you are not in a position to prepare the artefact as above, please contact PC chairs for an alternative arrangement. For instance, if you cannot provide us with a VM that contains licensed software, e.g., MatLab, please contact us, so we can find a solution.
