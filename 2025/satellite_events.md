## Call for Satellite Events (Workshops / Tutorials)

DisCoTec is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS).

[DisCoTec 2025](.) will gather three main conferences (COORDINATION, DAIS, FORTE) that cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects.

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for satellite events (workshops and tutorials) to be affiliated to DisCoTec 2025.
We welcome proposals on topics related to distributed systems: from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques, testing and verification methods, to language design and system implementation approaches.

In the past, DisCoTec has been accompanied by successful workshops and tutorials on a variety of emerging topics in distributed computing; please browse the pages of previous editions of DisCoTec to have an idea of past satellite events.

The satellite events (tutorials and workshops) will be held on **Monday, June 16, 2025** and on **Friday, June 20, 2025**.
