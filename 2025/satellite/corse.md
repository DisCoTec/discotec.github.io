# CORSE - Components Operationally: Reversibility and System Engineering

CORSE is a satellite workshop of DisCoTec 2025, held on June 16th in Lille, France.
This workshop aims to celebrate the 65th birthday of Jean-Bernard Stefani.




Jean-Bernard Sfenani, Head of Research at INRIA-Grenoble, has made significant contributions across various fields, including software engineering, system modeling, and the theoretical aspects of distributed systems. His primary research focus has been on component models, with recent work emphasizing reversibility. Also Jean-Bernard was an active member of the FMOODS / FORTE community within the DisCoTec confederation.
