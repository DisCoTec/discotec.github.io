# Gender Parity / Women in Science
>"*Les étoiles sont éclairées pour que chacun puisse un jour retrouver la sienne."

The rapid advancement of computer science over the past decades is the result of groundbreaking contributions by researchers, both men and women, whose work has shaped our modern world. Among them, many women have had a significant impact. *Ada Lovelace*, often regarded as the world's first programmer, envisioned the potential of computing long before modern computers existed and laid the foundations for algorithmic thinking. *Grace Hopper* designed the first compiler in 1951 and the Cobol language in 1959. These remarkable scientists, among many others, demonstrate the essential role women have played in the advancement of knowledge, and are the stars that continue to inspire future generations, illuminating research and academia. 


As part of the DisCoTec 2025 conference, we are organizing a “Women in Science” session to highlight the careers of women scientists.
The aim is to share researchers testimonies and experience as a women in computer science or a colleague and collaborator of women in science while inspiring young female researchers to pursue an academic career.

## Format
This event will be organized in the form of a panel with a short introductory speech by each of the panelists, followed by an open discussion.

## Date & place
Women in Science session will take place on the **18th of June 2025**. Precise time and location will be announced soon.

**Bio:** Adrian Francalanza is a Full Professor at the University of Malta, where he has been active in teaching and research for the past 15 years. Prior to this, he held postdoctoral positions at Imperial College London and the University of Southampton in the UK. His research focuses on static and runtime verification, particularly in relation to behavioural models and programming languages for concurrency and distributed systems. He recently served as Principal Investigator on an H2020 project exploring the integration of Behavioural Types with API-based software, and co-proposed an Icelandic  project investigating the theoretical foundations of runtime monitoring. He currently leads a Maltese project that applies runtime monitoring techniques to Industrial IoT environments.
