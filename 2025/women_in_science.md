The rapid advancement of computer science over the past decades is the result of groundbreaking contributions by researchers, both men and women, whose work has shaped our modern world. Among them, many women have had a significant impact. *Ada Lovelace*, often regarded as the world's first female programmer, envisioned the potential of computing long before modern computers existed and laid the foundations for algorithmic thinking. *Grace Hopper* designed the first compiler in 1951 and the Cobol language in 1959. These remarkable scientists, among many others, demonstrate the essential role women have played in the advancement of knowledge, and are the stars that continue to inspire future generations, illuminating research and academia. 


As part of the DisCoTec 2025 conference, we are organizing a “Women in Science” session to highlight the careers of women scientists.
The aim is to share researchers testimonies and experience as a women in computer science or a colleague and collaborator of women in science while inspiring young female researchers to pursue an academic career.

## Format
This event will be organized in the form of a panel with a short introductory speech by each of the panelists, followed by an open discussion.

## Date & place
Women in Science session will take place on the **18th of June 2025**. Precise time and location will be announced soon.
