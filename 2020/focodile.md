# FOCODILE 2020 - 1st International Workshop on Foundations of Consensus and Distributed Ledgers

FOCODILE 2020 is one of the workshops at DisCoTec 2020, the 15th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques. It will be held on June 19, 2020.

COVID-19 update
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, FOCODILE 2020 will be held online, as the rest of DisCoTec. No physical meeting/presentations will take place. Instead, the authors of accepted papers will give their talks remotely (or record their talks if they prefer), and discuss with the conference participants online. More details will follow.

## Scope
FOCODILE is a forum to exchange ideas and recent research findings on theoretical foundations of consensus and blockchain technology. Topics include, but are not limited to:

* Formal models of distributed consensus
* Blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives and protocols
* Formal verification of blockchain protocols and smart contracts
* Byzantine fault tolerance and consensus
* Design and analysis of distributed ledgers
* Blockchain consensus mechanisms
* Privacy and anonymity in cryptocurrencies
* Game-theoretic approaches to blockchains
* Post-quantum blockchain protocols
* Performance and scalability of blockchain systems

Contributions from doctoral students and young researchers are particularly encouraged.

## Keynote Speaker
Renowned researcher, worldwide leader on the topics of the workshop (TBA)
