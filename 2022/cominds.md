# First Workshop on Collaborative Mining for Distributed Systems


**COVID-19:** CoMinDs is planned as a physical, in-person event, with certain support for remote presence, both for speakers and for other participants who are unable or unwilling to come. Depending on the 
pandemic situation, we may have to make a decision whether to cancel the physical component of the event or not.


## Scope 

Nowadays, organizations increasingly need to coordinate to achieve their goals collaboratively and create new forms of business. This requires organizations to form (business-oriented) distributed systems, guaranteeing their interoperability. However, this task is made complex by the need to coordinate the interactions of various participants, dealing with requirements, constraints, and regulations coming from different organizations. In addition, many business scenarios started to involve more automated and highly distributed components such as robots and smart devices that perceive and interact with the dynamics arising from the physical world. 
Effective coordination and cooperation of such distributed systems demand the compatibility of the processes performed by each system component. Such cooperation can be supported by the observations of the whole systems’ behavior through collaborative mining, i.e., process mining applied in the presence of heterogeneous data produced by the system components, i.e., distributed event logs. Collaborative mining techniques address the discovery of collaborative models, thus fostering the coordination aspects that typically occur on distributed systems.
The objective of the CoMinDS workshop is to attract researchers and industry practitioners to discuss collaborative mining and present open challenges, state of the art, in-progress research, and practical experiences, including case studies. 
CoMinDS welcomes submissions of short papers (max 8 pages) presenting novel ideas, position papers, and presenting preliminary results within the theme of collaborative mining and regular paper (max 15 pages) discussing original research works. 
The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
* Construction of Distributed Event Logs
* Discovery of Collaborative Models
* Conformance Analysis for Collaborative Models
* Multi-perspective Collaborative Mining
* Privacy-preserving Collaborative Process Mining
* Distributed Systems Monitoring and Repair
* Collaborative Decision Mining 
* Streaming Collaborative Mining
