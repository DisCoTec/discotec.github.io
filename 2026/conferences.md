# Main Conferences
DisCoTec gathers conferences that cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects — from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques, testing and verification methods, to language design and system implementation approaches:

* [COORDINATION 2026](coordination) - International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages
* [DAIS 2026](dais) - International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems
* [FORTE 2026](forte) - International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems


## Publication

Authors are invited to submit papers electronically in PostScript or PDF using a two-phase online submission process. Registration of the paper information and abstract (max. 250 words) must be completed according to the [submission dates](dates) and submissions are handled through the EasyChair conference management system (submission links are provided on the individual conference sites).

Contributions must be written in English and report on original, unpublished work not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP’s Author Code of Conduct, see [http://www.ifip.org/](http://www.ifip.org/) under Publications/Links). The submissions must not exceed the total page number limit defined by the corresponding conference and prepared using [Springer’s LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Submissions not adhering to these constraints may be rejected without review.

### Proceedings

The proceedings of the main conferences will be published as volumes in the [Springer LNCS-IFIP](https://www.springer.com/series/8345) series.

The volumes will be **open access** from the [IFIP digital library](https://hal.inria.fr/IFIP/page/conferences) after a 3-year embargo.

The proceedings are freely accessible for the duration of the conference.

### Journal Special Issues
Selected papers accepted at the main conferences will be invited for submission to special issues in high-quality journals, such as:
* [Logical Methods in Computer Science](https://lmcs.episciences.org) 
* [Science of Computer Programming](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming/) ([Software Track](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming/call-for-software/a-new-software-track-on-original-software-publications-science-of-computer-programming)).

Please visit the page of each conference for details on these special issues.
