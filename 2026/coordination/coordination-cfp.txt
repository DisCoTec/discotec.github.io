Scope
-----

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent,
distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous
components. New models, architectures, languages and verification
techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the
demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have
emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that
cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing
modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software
development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this
conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community
of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and
implementation techniques for coordination.

Topics of Interest
------------------

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but
not limited to) foundational contributions, engineering techniques,
tools, applications, and inter-disciplinary aspects.

**A. Theoretical models and foundations for coordination**

- Concurrency Theory, Composition, Distribution, Mobility, Time and
  Spatial Models
- Semantics, Logic, and Type Systems
- Probabilistic / Stochastic / Quantitative Models
- Formal Verification & Validation, and Model Checking

**B. Coordination Paradigms & Languages**

- Coordination Models & Language
- Session Types & Communication Protocols, Choreographies, Orchestration
- Actor and Agent-Based Systems
- Multi-agent systems, agent organisations, and societies
- Collective intelligence, Ensembles, Swarms, Self-organisation, and
  Emergence
- Bio-inspired / Nature-inspired Coordination
- AI-Driven & Learning-Based Coordination

**C. Distributed & Pervasive & Modern Computing**

- Microservices, Web Services, and Middleware
- Distributed, Reversible, Grid, Networked, Parallel and
  High-Performance Computing and Algorithms
- (Distributed) Run-time verification and monitoring
- Coordination across the continuum: IoT, Edge, Fog, Cloud
- Cyber-Physical Coordination, Context-awareness, Pervasive computing,
  Situatedness, and Human-Machine Hybrid Systems
- Decentralised systems, Peer-to-peer computing, Smart Contracts &
  Blockchain Applications

**D. Software Engineering & Applications for Coordinated Systems**

- Dynamic / Domain-Specific Software: Analysis, Models, Architecture,
  Patterns
- Programming Methodologies, Programming Languages
- DevOps, Continuous Integration, and Automation
- Business Process Modelling & Process Mining
- Digital twin networks, coordination of the digital thread
- Industrial Applications & Case Studies across fields (swarm robotics,
  vehicular networks, smart cities and ecosystems)
- GenAI/LLM-based Approaches to Engineer Coordination

**E. Cross-Cutting and Multi-/Inter-/Trans-Disciplinary Aspects**

- Security, Privacy, and Dependability in Coordination
- Adaptation, Reconfiguration, and Self-\* properties
- Interdisciplinary & Societal Aspects of Coordination

**F. Coordination Platforms, Middleware, and Tools**

- Simulation Tools and Platforms
- Specification, Modelling, and Domain-specific Language Implementations
  and Workbenches
- Verification & Validation, Visualisation, and Testing Tools
- Distributed Middlewares and Platforms
- Datasets and Benchmarks for Coordination Systems

Keynote Speakers
----------------

- TBD

Paper categories
----------------

- **Regular papers** (12-18 pages, not counting references and
  appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and
  experience reports.

  - Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission.
    Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the
    Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is
    decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on
    it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the
    acceptance of the paper.

- **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and
  appendices): describing important results and success stories related
  to the topics of COORDINATION.

- **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices):
  describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics
  of COORDINATION.

  - Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool’s
    functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly
    with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle,
    and,when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly
    providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also
    provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including
    relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns,
    possibly including software architecture and core data structures.
    Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly
    describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously
    published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on
    enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition,
    **the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation**.
    Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be
    accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee.
    Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo
    video of at most 10 minutes length.


See the website for EasyChair submission instructions.

Proceedings
-----------

The proceedings of COORDINATION, DAIS, and FORTE will be published as
volumes in the Springer LNCS-IFIP series. The volumes will be open
access from the IFIP digital library after a 3-year embargo.

Journal Special Issues
----------------------

After the conference, accepted papers (except for tool papers) selected
from FORTE and COORDINATION programmes will be invited to a journal
special issue of the Logical Methods in Computer Science, with the
following tentative schedule:

- October/November 2026: deadline for the first submitted version;
- February 2027: notification for the first round of reviews.

Selected tool papers will be invited to a journal special issue of
Science of Computer Programming’s Software Track.
