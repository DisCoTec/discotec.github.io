# DAIS 2026 - 26th International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems

DAIS 2026 is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2026](.).

# Scope
The DAIS conference series addresses all practical and conceptual aspects of distributed applications, including their design, modeling, implementation and operation, the supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering methodologies and tools, as well as experimental studies and applications. Submissions will be judged on their originality, significance, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness.

The topics of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to:

Novel and innovative distributed applications and systems, particularly in the areas of
* middleware,
* cloud, edge and fog computing,
* big data processing,
* distributed embedded machine learning (TinyML),
* decentralised/distributed AI/ML,
* streaming and complex event processing,
* distributed social networking,
* IoT and cyber-physical systems,
* mobile computing,
* advanced networking (SDN/NFV),
* micro-services and service-oriented computing,
* peer-to-peer systems, and
* data center and internet-scale systems.

Novel architectures and mechanisms, particularly in the areas of
* publish/subscribe systems,
* epidemic protocols,
* language-based approaches,
* virtualization and resource allocation,
* distributed storage,
* large-scale data management,
* trusted execution environments,
* blockchains, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, and
* distributed consensus mechanisms.

System issues and design goals, including
* interoperability and adaptation,
* self-* properties (e.g., self-organization, self-management,...),
* security and practical applications of cryptography,
* trust and privacy,
* cooperation incentives and fairness,
* fault-tolerance and dependability,
* scalability and elasticity, and
* tail-performance and energy-efficiency.
