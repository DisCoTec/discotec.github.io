## Scope

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) foundational contributions, engineering techniques, tools, applications, and inter-disciplinary aspects.

**A. Theoretical models and foundations for coordination**

* Concurrency Theory, Composition, Distribution, Mobility, Time and Spatial Models

* Actor and Agent-Based Systems
* Multi-agent systems, agent organisations, and societies

**E. Cross-Cutting and Multi-/Inter-/Trans-Disciplinary Aspects**

## Submissions

### Submission link

Submission are via EasyChair at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2026](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2026)


### Submission categories:

* **Regular papers** (12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.

* **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.

* **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool's functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and,when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.

### Artefact Submission Instructions 📣

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges (see [EAPLS artifact badges](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges)).

<!-- Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf). -->

As advertised in the call for papers, artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the **Functional** badge. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.

A selection of artefacts may be invited for submission to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP). For reference, see the selected artefacts published in the [SCP special issue from DisCoTec 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/10WV5F3DZBD).

Choose the "COORDINATION Artefacts 2026" track in EasyChair when submitting your artefact.
