## Scope

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) foundational contributions, engineering techniques, tools, applications, and inter-disciplinary aspects.

## Submissions
Before any submission, please study Coordination [Policy for the Use of Generative AI](#policy-for-the-use-of-generative-ai) for the authors.


### Submission link

Submission are via EasyChair at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2026](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2026)


### Submission categories

* **Regular papers** (12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.

* **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.

* **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool's functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and,when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.

### Artefact Submission Instructions 📣

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges (see [EAPLS artifact badges](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges)).

<!-- Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf). -->

As advertised in the call for papers, artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the **Functional** badge. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.

A selection of artefacts may be invited for submission to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP). For reference, see the selected artefacts published in the [SCP special issue from DisCoTec 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/10WV5F3DZBD).

Choose the "COORDINATION Artefacts 2026" track in EasyChair when submitting your artefact.


### Policy for the Use of Generative AI
Authors are allowed to use generative AI tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in writing or research. However, authors must take full responsibility for all content in their paper, including any content generated by AI tools that might be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct. We encourage authors to explain any notable ways in which these tools were used in their research methodology. LLMs are not eligible for authorship. 

Below we list the acceptable and unacceptable uses of generative AI for authors.  Note that acceptable use cases only apply where confidentiality is not an issue. 

##### Unacceptable Uses:

- It is not acceptable to use generative AI to draft paper sections. In essence, papers MUST be written by humans.
- It is not acceptable to use generative AI-created visuals (images or videos). Specific exceptions are included in the [Springer Nature AI Policy](https://www.springer.com/us/editorial-policies/artificial-intelligence--ai-/25428500); licensed visuals, AI-focused research images, or those created with verifiable scientific tools. All approved AI-generated visuals must be **explicitly labeled as AI-generated**.

##### Acceptable Uses:

- As an algorithmic technique for research study in your research e.g. LLMs for generating formal models from requirements in natural language.
- As an aid to correct written text (spell checkers, grammar checkers) solely written by the authors.
- As an aid to language translation, however, the human is responsible for the accuracy of the final text.
- As an evaluation technique (to assist in finding inconsistencies or other anomalies).
- It is permissible to include LLM generated text snippets as examples in research papers where appropriate, but these MUST be clearly labeled and their use explained.
- Assist in code writing, however, the human is responsible for the code.
- Create documentation for code, however, the human is responsible for the correct documentation.
- To discover background information on a topic, subject to verification from trusted sources.


<!--Reviewers are also subject to limitation on the use of AI for their review activity:

- Generally speaking, it is not acceptable to use generative AI to carry out reviewing activities. 
- Firstly, writing reviews is an important part of the scientific process and they require scientific judgement.  PC members should use their expertise in the field for producing an insightful, professional, and constructive personal review.
- Secondly, review processes are in general confidential and should not be shared with third parties, including commercial LLM providers. So, even the use of generative AI just to improve English and the readability of reviews is discouraged.-->

### Review

The review process is **single-blind**. We will try to provide at least three reviews per paper.


### Publication

Publication of proceedings is coordinated among the three DisCoTec conferences (see the [Conferences](conferences) page for details). The <!-- [COORDINATION proceedings](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-95589-1) -->
COORDINATION proceedings are published by Springer as an LNCS-IFIP volume and  comprise accepted submissions from __all__ categories.
