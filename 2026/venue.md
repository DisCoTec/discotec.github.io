## How to arrive



### Travel by Air

If you are traveling from abroad, the reccommended option is to reach **Bologna** by plane (airport code: [BLQ](https://www.bologna-airport.it/en/welcome-to-bologna-airport/?idC=62175)), then take a train to **Pesaro**, and finally connect with Urbino by bus.

Bologna's train station (Bologna Centrale) is easily reachable from the airport. From there, there are two options for tickets:

* If you take a highspeed train (`Frecciarossa') from Bologna Centrale to Pesaro, you can buy an integrated ticket that includes also the  bus to Urbino ("Urbino Link"). This ticket is directly sold by [Trenitalia](https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html).

* The cheaper option is to reach Pesaro with a regional train. In this case you must separately buy a bus ticket. You will need an Adriabus ticket for the LV live (LV stands for "linea verde", "green line"). See this [website](https://www.adriabus.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EXTRAURBANO-rev.-dal-27-10-2025.pdf) for schedules (check: "LV - Pesaro > Montecchio > Morciola > Urbino").

Altenative (but smaller) airports are **Ancona** (Falconara, airport code: AOI) and **Rimini** (airport code: RMI). You can reach Pesaro from there as follows:
*  From Ancona airport you should take the shuttle bus “Raffaello” to Ancona train station, then take a train towards Bologna or Rimini and stop in Pesaro or Fano. 

* From Rimini airport, you should take the bus to Rimini train station and then connect with Pesaro by train (highspeed and regional options available).
