# COORDINATION 2024 - 26th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

COORDINATION 2024 is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2024](.).

## Scope
Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, rchitectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Main topics
Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:
* Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics.
* Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour.
* Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing.
* Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools.
* Models, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications.
* Languages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination. 
* Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity.
* Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination.
* Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects.
* Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing.
* Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing.
* Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches.
* Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models.       
* Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies.
* Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination.

## Submissions

### Submission site
[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2024)


### Publication
Authors are invited to submit papers electronically in PostScript or PDF using a two-phase online submission process. Registration of the paper information and abstract (max. 250 words) must be completed according to the above submission dates and submissions are handled through the EasyChair conference management system, accessible from the above submission site.

Contributions must be written in English and report on original, unpublished work not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP’s Author Code of Conduct, see [http://www.ifip.org/](http://www.ifip.org/) under Publications/Links). The submissions must not exceed the total page number limit (see below) prepared using [Springer’s LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Submissions not adhering to the above specified constraints may be rejected without review.

<!--
**NOTE**: a lightweight rebuttal will be introduced during the reviewing phase, allowing reviewers to ask for a quick rebuttal in case of a clearly identifiable issue that seems decisive for the review outcome and which can likely be quickly clarified by the authors. The rebuttal is only used when such questions arise, so not necessarily for all papers.
-->

Submission categories:
* **Regular papers** (7-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. In a clear case of need, as an exception, authors may ask for permission via email to the PC co-chairs to exceed the paper’s max length by at most 10%, under the condition that last-minute shortening would really damage the clarity of the paper or result in non-submission. The authors must make a draft of the paper available to the PC co-chairs via EasyChair.
* **Short papers** (4-6 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing research in progress, call for action, or opinion papers on the past of COORDINATION research, on the current state of the art, or on prospects for the years to come.
* **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.
* **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool's functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and,when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.

### Artefacts
Following [ACM's definition](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current), an artefact is "a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results".

To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in the COORDINATION community, authors of submitted papers are invited to submit publicly available artefacts (using permanent repositories such as [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/howto-archive-and-reference-your-code/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), etc.), which will be associated with their paper for evaluation. Based on the result of the artefact evaluation, one or more badges may be applied to a paper. Specifically, COORDINATION uses the [EAPLS badging scheme)](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges), which in its own turn is based on and consistent with the ACM initiative.

Artefact submission is mandatory for tool papers and the result of the artefact evaluation will be considered in the tool paper’s acceptance decision. Instead, artefact submission is optional for all the other paper categories and the result of the artefact evaluation will not affect the paper’s acceptance decision but may affect the best paper selection.

Dates (AoE):
* Artefact submission: ~~February 29, 2024~~ March 8, 2024
* Kick-the-tires phase:
  - Problem reports from reviewers: ~~8 March, 2024~~ March 17 2024
  - Authors' response to reviewers: ~~15 March, 2024~~ March 23 2024
* Artefact notification: ~~March 29, 2024~~ April 5, 2024

Detailed information on artefact submission and evaluation is available [here](ae_coordination.md). 

### Proceedings
The conference proceedings, consisting of accepted submissions from any paper category, will be published by Springer in [LNCS-IFIP](https://www.springer.com/series/8345) volumes.
